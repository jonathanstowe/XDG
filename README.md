# XDG

Perl 6 access to data provided by the xdg spec http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/ loosely based on pyxdg

## Description

This is loosely based on the interface of python module pyxdg. But due to the
differences between Python and Perl 6 it may do some things differently.

It provides a set of facilities for managing the configuration and data
of applications and managing some user settings provided by various
desktop environments.

It is probably only any use to you if you are using a system that
uses one of the desktop environments that support the freedesktop.org
specifications, such as Gnome or KDE or applications that are designed
to work in those environments.

## Installation

Assuming you have a working Rakudo Perl 6 installation you should be able to
install this with *zef* :

     zef install XDG 

## Support

Suggestions/patches are welcomed via github at

https://github.com/jonathanstowe/XDG/issues

I'm not able to test on a wide variety of platforms so any help there
would be appreciated.

## Licence

This is free software.
